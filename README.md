# PastWork

+ Calculates Relative Percent Difference (RPD) and recovery for quality control checks for ICP-OES data, highlightling passing percentage errors in blue, technical passes in gray, and failures in red.

+ DUP stands for duplicate - a sample processed and measured twice. Used to gauge reproducibility of analysis.

+ LFM stands for Laboratory Fortified Matrix - a sample with a known concentration of analyte added to it. Used to measure     suitability of preparation and analysis by gauging whether or not entire amount of analyte spiked into sample is measured at expected concentration.

+ To test functionality, copy/paste the sample data sets in the separate tabs into the highlighted yellow box in the PSL tab, and click the blue "DUP" button, followed by "LFM".
